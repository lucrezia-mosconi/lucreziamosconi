## Week 1 - Introduction to General Topology

  + ### Lecture 1.1

![Lecture 1.1 (2024).pdf](/assets/lecture_1.1_(2024)_1738670613967_0.pdf)

      + **Topology**: abstract mathematical study of geometric structures unaltered by elastic change of shape and size

        + > Within epistemic logic:

      + #### Topological space

        + > A topological space is a pair $(X, \tau)$, where X is a non empty set and $\tau$ is a family of subsets of X such that:
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}1. $\varnothing \in \tau, X \in \tau$ (Tautology and contradiction are both in the set)
2. $\tau$ is closed under *finite* intersection (The conjunction of two propositions is in the set)
3. $\tau$ is closed under *arbitrary* unions (We can form infinite disjunctions)
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + **Epistemic Meaning of Axioms**:

        + Tautologies and contradictions are decidable properties.
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + The conjunciton fo two verifiable properties is verifiable, the disjunction of two falsifiable properties is falsifiable.
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + An arbitrary disjunction fo verifiable properties is verifiable; an arbitrary conjunction of falsifiable properties is falsifiable.
logseq.order-list-type:: number

      + The intuition for arbitrary disjunctions

        + {{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}The elements of $\tau$ are called *open sets*/*opens*
{{< / logseq/orgNOTE >}}

        + **Definition**: A set $C \subseteq X$ is closed $\iff$ it is a complement of an open set, i.e. it is of the form $C = X \ O$ for some $O \in \tau$

          + ##### Examples of Topological Spaces

          + > **Indiscrete topology** $(X, \tau)$: X is an arbitrary set and $\tau = \{\varnothing, X\}$

          + > **Discrete topology** $(X, \tau)$: X is an arbitrary set and $\tau = P(X)$

          + {{< logseq/orgIMPORTANT >}}Any topology on an arbitrary set X contains the indiscrete topology and is contained by the discrete topology.
{{< / logseq/orgIMPORTANT >}}

          + > **Standard topology** $(\mathbb{R}, \tau)$: Let $\mathcal{B} = \{(a,c)| a, c \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } a < c\}$. Then, for $O \subseteq \mathbb{R}, O \in \tau \iff$ there exists some indexing set I such that $O = \bigcup_{i \in I} b_i$, where all $b_i \in \mathcal{B}$

          + > **Alexandroff Topology** $(\mathbb{N}, \tau)$: $\tau = \{ m | m \geq n \} | \text{for some } n \in \mathbb{N}\} \cup \{\varnothing\}$. This is an *Alexandroff* topology on $\mathbb{N}$ since the intersection of any family of opens is itself an open [closed under *arbitrary* intersections].

      + #### Subbasis, Basis, Generated Topology

        + > A subbasis is a family $\mathcal{B} \subseteq P(X)$ of subsets of a set X such that for every point $x \in X$ there exists some set $O \in \mathcal{B}$ with $x \in O$, i.e. $\bigcup \mathcal{B} = X$

        + >A Basis $\mathcal{B}$ is a subbasis satisfying the following: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$\forall B, B' \in \mathcal{B}, \forall x \in B \cap B' \exists B'' \in \mathcal{B}$ s.t. $x \in B'' \subseteq B \cap B'$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + > The topology $\tau_{\mathcal{B}}$ generated by $\mathcal{B}$ on X is the *smallest* topology on X that contains $\mathcal{B}$. It contains: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}1. $\varnothing, X$
2. Finite intersections of $ B \in \mathcal{B}$
3. Arbitrary unions of sets $B \in \mathcal{B}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + ##### Epistemic Interpretation:

          + element of a sub-basis” as “evidence”:directly observable property of the world

      + #### Important Example: Euclidean Topology

        + **Epistemic Interpretation**

        + 

  + ### Lecture 1.2

![Lecture 1.2 (2024).pdf](/assets/lecture_1.2_(2024)_1738746314687_0.pdf)

    + Some basic definitions:

      + #### Neighborhood

        + > An open neighborhood of a point $x \in X$ is an open set $U \in \tau$ which contains $x$.

      + #### Interior Point

        + > An interior point of a set $A \subseteq X$ is a point $x \in X$ such that there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $U \subseteq A$

        + #### Interior

          + The **Interior** of A is the set of all its interior points:

          + {{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$Int(A) = \{ x \in X | \exists U \in \tau \ s.t. \ x \in U \subseteq A\}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

          + Note: Int is an open set and it is the *largest* open subset of A.

          + ##### Epistemic Interpretation:

            + $Int(A)$ as "A is Known (or Knowable)" based on evidence

      + #### Closed Point

        + > A closed point of a set A is a point $x \in X$ such that every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contains a point $y$, which might (or not) be equal to x

          + The **closure** of A is the set of a is the set of all closed points of A

          + {{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$Cl(A) = \{ x \in X | \exists U \in \tau \ s.t. \ x \in U \rightarrow U \cap A \neq \varnothing\}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

          + Note: The closure of A is the smallest closed set containing A

          + **Fact**: $Cl(A) = X \setminus Int(X\setminus A)$ for all $A \subseteq X$

          + ##### Epistemic Interpretation:

            + $Cl(A)$ as "A is epistemically possible" (i.e. compatible with all evidence)

      + #### Limit Point

        + > A limit point fo a set A is a point $x \in X$ such that every neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contains a point $y$ with $y \neq x$

          + The **Cantor Derivative** of A is the set of its limit points:

          + {{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$d(A) = \{ x \in X | \forall U \in \tau \ s.t. \ x \in U \rightarrow (U \setminus \{x\} \cap A \neq \varnothing)\}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

          + Note: $Cl(A) = A \cup d(A)$ for all $A \subseteq X$

          + 

      + #### Isolated Point

        + > An isolated point of A is a point $x \in A$ that is **not** a limit point of A

      + #### Boundary

        + > The boundary of a set $A \subseteq X$ is defined as: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$Bd(A) = Cl(A) \setminus Int(A)$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

      + 

    + We now look closer at the interior and closure operators:

      + #### Properties of $Int(A)$ and $Cl(A)$

      + > The $Cl$ operators of any topological space $(X, \tau)$ satisfies the *Kuratowsky axioms*, i.e.

        + $Cl(\varnothing) = \varnothing$
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + $A \subseteq Cl(A) \ \forall A\subseteq X$
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + $Cl(A \cup B) = Cl(A) \cup Cl(B)$
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + $Cl(Cl(A)) = Cl(a) \ \forall A\subseteq X$
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + {{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}Any $Cl$ operator satisfying the Kuratowsky axioms imposes a topology on X. 
{{< / logseq/orgNOTE >}}

      + > The $Int$ operator of any topological space $(X, \tau)$ then satisfies the dual properties:

      + $Int(X) = X$
logseq.order-list-type:: number

      + $Int(A) \subseteq (A)$
logseq.order-list-type:: number

      + $Int(A \cap B) = Int(A) \cap Int(B)$
logseq.order-list-type:: number

      + $Int(Int(A)) = Int(A)$
logseq.order-list-type:: number

      + {{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}Again, any $Int$ operator satisfying these axioms 
{{< / logseq/orgNOTE >}}

      + ##### Epistemic Interpretation of the Kuratowsky Axioms

        + Knowability of Tautology 
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + Factivity of Knowledge/Knowability $K(A) \rightarrow A$
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + Distributivity over Conjunction $(K(A \rightarrow B) \ then  \ K(A) \rightarrow K(B)$
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + Positive Introspection (*if x is knowable, then it is knowable that x is knowable*)
logseq.order-list-type:: number

    + Other interesting properties of sets $A \subseteq X$ where $(X,\tau)$ is a topology:

      + #### Local Closure

        + > A is locally closed if it is of the form $A = U \cap C$ where $U \in \tau$ open set and $C$ is a closed set.

      + #### Dense

        + > A is dense if every open set $U \in \tau$ intersects A,  i.e. $\forall U \in \tau, U \cap A \neq \varnothing$.

      + #### Nowhere Dense

        + > A is nowhere dense if $Int(Cl(A)) = \varnothing$ , i.e. if the interior of its complement $Int(X \setminus A)$ is dense.

      + #### Dense in itself

        + > A is dense-in-itself if every $x \in A$ is a limit point of A, i.e. $A \subseteq d(A)$.

    + #### The Baire Space

      + We give here an important topology, i.e. **The Baire Space**

      + $X = N^\omega$ = { infinite sequences **n** = $(n^1, n^2, \ldots)$ of natural numbers }, $\tau$ = {countable unions of fans}

        + >This means $A \subseteq R^n$ is open iff it is of the form:
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$A = \bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty [e_i^{\rightarrow}]$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + Where each $e_i^{\rightarrow}$ is a finite sequence $(e_i^1, e_i^2, \ldots e_i^j)$ of natural numbers, and  $[e_i^{\rightarrow}]$ = { **n** $\in X | n^k =  e_i^{\rightarrow}$ for all $1 \leq k \leq j$ } is called the *fan* with handle $e_i^{\rightarrow}$. 
        + ##### Epistemic Interpretation

          + A baire space can be interpreted as a universal learning space. We can think of an agent successively observint "data" in an infinite discrete time. A possible world in a possible observational history: an infinite sequence of data. Only one of the these worlds is the "real", actual one. that corresponds to what will actually be observed. But at each time, the agent has only observed an initial finie sequence of data $e_i^{\rightarrow}$

    + #### The Cantor Space

      + Similarly, we can define the Cantor space, where $\tau$ is defined in the same way, but X is defined as follows:

      + $X = 2^\omega$ =  { infinite sequences **n** =  $(n_1, n_2, \ldots )$ of bits $n_i \in \{0, 1\}$ }

    + #### The Upset Topology

      + The upset topology has as its $\tau$ the set of all upsets of X, i.e. all upward closed sets of  X.

        + **Definition**: Given any pre order on a set X, $A \subseteq X$ is an **upset** iff for all $x, y \in X, x \in A$ and $x \leq y$ implies $y \in A$

        + The upwards closure of a set $A$  is the smallest subset that includes $A$, i.e. 
> $\uparrow A = \{ y \in X | \exists x \ in A (x \leq y)\}$

        + >Therefore we have: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$\tau = \{ U \subseteq X | U$ is an upset $\}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

  + ### Lecture 1.3

![Lecture 1.3 (2024).pdf](/assets/lecture_1.3_(2024)_1738932111369_0.pdf)

    + Some basic definitions for the **upset topology**

      + > A **basis** for the upset topology is given by: $\mathcal{B} = \{\uparrow x | x \in X\}$

      + > The **interior**. in the upset topology is the same as athe Kripke modality 
$[\leq]A$ or $\square$: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$Int(A) = \{x \in X | \uparrow x \subseteq A \} =[\leq]A$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + Where $[\leq]A$ is defined as follows: $\{x \in X| \forall y \in X (x \leq y \rightarrow y \in A)\}$

    + #### The Alexandroff Topology

      + A topological space is an **Alexandroff space** if $\tau$ is closed under arbitrary intersections.

        + {{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}There is a tight link between the *reflexive and transitive* Kripke frames and Alexandroff spaces, since they are nothing but preordered sets, they are equivalent to one another. 
{{< / logseq/orgNOTE >}}

        + ##### Preorders $\rightarrow$ Topologies

        + {{< logseq/orgIMPORTANT >}}Every upset topology is an Alexandroff Topology.
{{< / logseq/orgIMPORTANT >}}

        + ##### Topologies $\rightarrow$ Preorderss

        + We first introduce the **specialisation** preorder:

        + > Given two points $x, y \in X$, we say that x is a specialisation of y , $x \sqsubseteq_\tau y$ if every open neighbourhood of x  is also a neighbourhood of y.

          + Note that if we are given a subbasis $\mathcal{B}$ for the topology $\tau$, then it is easy to see that: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$x \sqsubseteq_\tau y \iff \forall U \in \mathcal{B} (x \in U \rightarrow y \in U)$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + ###### Epistemic Interpretation

          + If we see the states $x \in X$ as possible theories of everything, then $x \sqsubset_\tau y$ means that x is a simpler theory than y, i.e. it satisfies less observable properties than y, or similarly that it is easier to falsify than y.

        + We now give more facts about the **specialisation preorder**:

          + Every open set is upwards closed with respect to the specialisation preorder. 
logseq.order-list-type:: number

          + The interior is included in the Kripke modality for the specialisation preorder.
logseq.order-list-type:: number

    + #### The refinement relation

      + The refinement relation is simply the **inclusion relation** between topologies:

        + > Given topologies $\tau \subseteq \tau'$ on the same set X, we say that $\tau$ is *coarser* than $\tau'$, or equivalently that $\tau'$ is *finer.*

        + The refinement relation $\subseteq$ is a partial order on all topologies on a given set X: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$Top(X) = \{\tau | \tau$ topology on $X \}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + {{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}$(Top(X), \subseteq)$ is a complete lattice, where the top of the lattice is the discrete topology $P(X)$, and the bottom of the lattice is the trivial topology $\{X , \varnothing\}$
{{< / logseq/orgNOTE >}}

        + ###### Epistemic Interpretation

        + We can think of the refinement relation as expanding one's observational capacities due to an increase in the accuracy of our measurement instruments.

    + #### Operations on topologies:

      + We now consider the meet and join of topologies in the lattice $(Top(X), \subseteq)$.

      + > The **meet** $\tau \land \tau'$ of two topologies is the largest topology included in both, i.e. it is exactly the **intersection** of the two topologies.

      + > The **join** $\tau \lor \tau'$ of two topologies is the smallest topology that includes both, i.e. is the subbasis generated by the union of the two topologies (***NOT*** the union of the two topologies).

      + ###### Epistemic Interpretation

      + The meet represents the evidence that is observable by both agents, i.e. the common evidence. The interior operator on the meet captures a form of **common knowledge**, i.e. what is knowable based on evidence available to both agents.

      + The join represents the result of sharing all the evidence between two agents. The interior operator on the join represents what the group of agents can come to know, i.e. the implicit group knowledge  or **distributed knowledge**.

    + #### Creating new topological spaces

      + > The **subspace topology on Y** is the restriction of the original topology to Y: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$\tau_Y = \{U \cap Y | U \in \tau\}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + We call $(Y, \tau_y)$ a subspace of $(X, \tau)$

        + ###### Epistemic interpretation

          + Learning, updating with new information

      + > Let $\{\mathcal{X_i}_{i \in I}\}$ be a family of pairwise disjoint topological spaces. The **topological sum** is the pair $\bigoplus_{i \in I}\mathcal{X}_i = (\bigcup_{i \in I} X_i, \tau)$ where: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$\tau = \{U \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I} X_i | U \cap X_i \in \tau_i \forall i \in I\}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + ###### Epistemic interpretation

          + 1. The sum is the opposite of learning: forgetting some observation made in the past.

          + 2. We can also interpret it as modelling the situation before a specific $X_i$ was observed, in order to reason about past knowledge

          + 3. Can also be seen as a way of reasoning about counterfactual knowledge: what would I have known if I *didn't* observe this specific $X_i$?

      + > The **product topology** is the topology on the Cartesian product $X \times Y$ generated by the basis 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$\mathcal{B} = \{ U \times V | U \in \tau_X, V \in \tau_Y\}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + ###### Epistemic Interpretation

          + Raising new questions, simultaneously observing two variables $x, y \in X, Y$ respectively

      + To introduce the **quotient topology**, we first need to introduce the concept of a *quotient space*:

        + Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on X, the quotient space $X/\sim$ has as points the equivalence classes: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$X/\sim = \{[x] | x \in X\}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

      + > An open in the quotient topology $X/ \sim$ is any collection of equivalence classes $A\subseteq X /\sim$ such that the union of members of A is *open* in the original topology.

        + ###### Epistemic interpretation

          + Forgetting or abstracting away from some features of the world. The partition generated by the equivalence relation is a question, while the cells are the possible answers.

    + #### Functions

      + We now consider some functions between two arbitrary topologies $(X, \tau_X), (Y, \tau_Y)$.

        + >A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is **continuous**  $\iff$ the *f-preimage* of every open set is open, i.e. 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$f^{-1}(U) \in \tau_x , \ \forall U \in \tau_Y$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + > $f$ is an **open** map if the *image* of every open set is open, i.e. 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$f(U) \in \tau_Y, \ \forall U \in \tau_X$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + > $f$ is an **interior** map if it is both *open and continuous*.

        + >$f$ is a **closed** map if the *image* of every open set is closed.

    + #### Homeomorphisms

      + > A map $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is an homeomorphism if it is a *bijective* map s.t. both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are *continuous*.

        + We say that two spaces are homeomorphic if there exists a homeomorphism between them.

        + {{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}A **topological property** is a property of topological spaces that is preserved by homeomorphisms. 
{{< / logseq/orgNOTE >}}

      + #### Topological properties

      + We now give some examples of topological properties:

      + ##### Separation Properties

        + > A topological space is a $T_0$ space iff for every two points $x \neq y \in X$ there exists a $U \in \tau$ such that 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}Either $x \in U \land y \notin U$, *or* $x \notin U \land y \in U$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + > A topological space is a $T_d$ space iff for every point $x$ there exists a neighborhood $U$ of x s.t. $\{x\}$ is closed in $U$.

        + > A topological space is a $T_1$ space if for every two points $x \neq y \in X$ there exists a $U , U'\in \tau$ such that 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$x \in U \land y \notin U$ *and* $x \notin U' \land y \in U'$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + >  A topological space is a $T_1$ space if for every two points $x \neq y \in X$ there exists a $U , U'\in \tau$ such that $U \cap U' = \varnothing$ and:
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$x \in U$ *and* $y \in U'$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + {{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}$(T_2) \rightarrow (T_1) \rightarrow (T_d) \rightarrow (T_0)$
{{< / logseq/orgNOTE >}}

        + ##### Epistemic interpretation

        + Qualitative classification of topologies, depending on how well they can separate points/states.

        + 

        + 

      + ##### Other examples

      + > A topological space is **connected** if the only clopen sets are $\varnothing, X$. Otherwise, it is *disconnected*

      + > A space is **separable** if there exists a dense countable subset

      + > A space is **second countable** if it has a countable (sub)basis.

      + > A space is **compact** if every open cover of X has a finite subcover, where a *cover*  (and subcover) is defined as follows: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}A family of subsets $\mathcal{F}$ s.t. $\bigcup\mathcal{F}= X$, while a subcover is another cover       $\mathcal{F}' \subseteq \mathcal{F}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

      + > A space is **dense in itself** if $d(X) =X$, i.e. every point is a limit point of $X$.

      + > A space is **extremally disconnected** if the closure of every open set is open, and hence clopen.

    + #### Metric Topology

      + First, we need to introduce the concept of a metric:

      + > A **metric** is a function $d : X \rightarrow [0, \infty]$ satisfying the following:
1. $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x=y$
2. $d(x, y) = d(y,x)$
3. $d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(z, y)$

      + ###### Metric Space

      + A metric space is a pair $(X,d)$, where $d$  is a metric on $X$.

      + ###### Metric Topology

      + > The *metric topology* generated by $d$ is the topology generated by the basis: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$\mathcal{B} = \{ B(x, \epsilon) | x \in X, \epsilon > 0\}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}
Where $B(x, \epsilon) = \{y \in X | d(x,y) < \epsilon\}$ are the *open balls*.

      + A topological space is **metrizable** if its topology is generated by some metric $d$, and this is a **topological property**.

        + {{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}Every metrizable space is $T_2$.

![Lecture 2.2 (2023).pdf](/assets/lecture_2.2_(2023)_1739350403772_0.pdf)

  + We begin by introducing topological models for a single agent:

  + #### Topo-model

    + > A topo-model is a triplet where:
1. **X** = $(X, \tau)$ is a topological space
2. $|| \bullet || : Prop \rightarrow P(X)$ is a map associating to each atomic proposition $p \in Prop$ some set of points $||p|| \subseteq X$

  + We now specify the semantics of the operators

  + #### Interior Semantics

    + We can recursively define a **satisfaction relation** $\models_M$ between the points in x of a given topo model **M** and formulas $\phi$ in our language.

    + > $x \models p \iff x \in ||p||$
$x \models \psi \land \phi \iff x \models \phi$ and $x \models \psi$
$x \models \neg \psi \iff x \not\models \psi$
$x \models \square \psi \iff \exists U \in \tau (x \in U s.t. y \models \psi \ \forall y \in U)$

    + We can then define new semantic rules by noting the equivalences in term of primitive connectives for $\lor, \rightarrow, \lozenge$

      + > $x \models \psi \lor \phi \iff x \models \phi$ or $x \models \psi$
$x \models \psi \rightarrow \phi \iff$ ($x \models \phi$ then $x \models \psi$)
$x \models \lozenge \psi \iff \forall U \in \tau$ ($x \in U$ s.t.  $y \models \psi$ for some $y \in U$)

    + #### Interpretation Map

    + we can extend the valuation $||p||_M$ to an **interpretation map** for all propositional formulas $\psi$, by stipulating that 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$||\phi||_M = \{x \in X | x \models_M \psi\}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

    + {{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}Note that with the above, we have $||\square \psi || = Int_X||\psi||$ and conversely $||\lozenge \psi || = Cl_X||\psi||$
{{< / logseq/orgNOTE >}}

    + #### Truth and Validity

    + Truth, satisfiability and validity are defined in the standard way both on models, topological spaces and classes of spaces in the standard way.

      + >eg. $\phi$ is valid on a topological space $(X, \tau)$ if it is valid in all topo-models M = $(X, \tau, ||\bullet ||)$, i.e. if it is true at all points and for all valuations.

    + ##### Epistemic Interpretation

      + We write $K\phi$ instead of $\square \phi$, and interpret this semantics as an evidence-based conception of knowledge.

        + This gives us that $\phi$ is known/knowable $\iff$ 
The agent has all the correct evidence for $\phi \iff$ 
There is some directly observable evidence that supports $\phi$.

        + **Points** $x \in X$ represent all the possibilities that are consistent with an agent's information.

          + | Epistemology | Topology |
|Basic evidence| Subbasis $\mathcal{B} \ni U$ |
|Combined evidence | Basis $\mathcal{B} \ni U$ |
| Verifiable evidence | Open sets $\tau \ni U$|
|Factive evidence | Open Neighborhood $\tau \ni U \ni x$|

    + 

  + We show one way of comparing topo-models

  + #### Topo-Bisimulations

    + A topo-bisimulation between topo-models $M, M'$ is a non empty relation $\sim \subseteq X \times X'$ such that $x \sim x'$ implies:

      + > **Valuation Preservation** $x \in ||p|| \iff x' \in ||p||'$
**Forth condition** For every $U \in \tau$ of x there exists some $U' \in \tau'$ of x' such that for every $y' \in U'$ there is a $y \in U$ and $y \sim y'$
**Back condition** For every $U' \in \tau$ of x' there exists some $U \in \tau$ of x such that for every $y \in U$ there is a $y' \in U'$ and $y \sim y'$

        + We then say that two points are **bisimilar** if there exists a bisimulation $\sim$ such that $x \sim x'$

        + {{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}When the topologies are Alexandroff, the notion coincides with the standard concept of bisimulation in modal logic. 
{{< / logseq/orgNOTE >}}

  + We checked which properties are definable in the language

  + #### Topo-definability

    + > We say that a class  K of topological spaces is topologically definable if there exists some formula $\phi$ in the language of basic modal logic such that we have $(X, \tau) \in K \iff (X, \tau) \models \phi$ for every space $(X, \tau)$

      + The following properties are **not** topo-definable:

        + Connectedness
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + Compactness
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + The separation properties ($T_1, T_2, T_d$ etc.)
logseq.order-list-type:: number

  + We gave extensions of the language introduced earlier by providing new modalities.

  + #### Extensions of the language

    + ###### Global Modality

      + Add the operator $\forall \psi$, and its De Morgan dual $\exists \phi$ with the following semantics:

        + >$x \models \forall \psi \iff y \models \phi$ for every $y \in X$

          + Conversely:$x \models \exists \psi \iff y \models \phi$ for some $y \in X$

      + ###### Epistemic interpretation

      + $\forall \psi$ represents "having the information that" or "having *infallible knowledge* that. This kind of knowledge is based off hard information and so it is absolutely certain and guaranteed to be true.

      + {{< logseq/orgIMPORTANT >}}By adding this operator, we can now capture connectedness with the formula 
$\forall(\square p \lor \square \neg p) \rightarrow (\forall p \lor \forall \neg p)$
{{< / logseq/orgIMPORTANT >}}

      + However, separation properties are **still undefinable**.

    + ##### Difference Modality

      + Adding the difference modality $D\phi$ interpreted as: $\mathcal{X}, x \models D\phi \iff \mathcal{X}, x \models \phi$ for some $y \in X$ such that $x \neq y$

        + {{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}With this extension, $T_0, T_1$ become definable.

### Lecture 2.3

![Lecture 2.3 (2023).pdf](/assets/lecture_2.3_(2023)_1739441143740_0.pdf)

  + We go through soundness and completeness results for the logic **S4** on topo-models

  + #### Soundness

    + > The logic **S4** is sound on topo-models, i.e. every theorem of **S4**  is topologically valid

  + #### Completeness

    + > The logic **S4** is complete on topo-models, i.e. every topologically valid formula is a theorem of **S4**.

      + Note: **S4** is strongly complete, and also weakly complete wrt. finite topo models

      + ##### Proof 1 - Via relational completeness

        + It follows from standard results in modal logic, i.e.:

          + The strong completeness of *S4* wrt. relational models (via canonical models)
logseq.order-list-type:: number

          + The strong finite model property wrt. relational models (via transitive filtration)
logseq.order-list-type:: number

      + #### Proof 2 - Via canonincal topo-model

        + > General strategy: take a S4-consistent set $\phi \subseteq \mathcal{L}_\square$ and show that it is topologically consistent

        + {{< logseq/orgNOTE >}}We have a Lindenbaum lemma for maximal consistency as in modal logic.
{{< / logseq/orgNOTE >}}

        + ##### Canonical topo model

          + The canonical topo-model is defined as follows:

            + > $\mathcal{X}^c = (X^c, \tau^c, || \bullet ||^c)$ where:
1. $X^c = \{ T \subseteq \mathcal{L}^c | T \text{ is maximally consistent}\}$
2. $\tau^c$ is the canonical topology generated by the canonical basis 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$\mathcal{B} = \{ (\square \phi)^* | \phi \in \mathcal{L}_\square\}$       where              $(\theta)^*  = \{T  \in X^c | \theta \in T\}$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}
3. The canonical valuation $||p||^c = (p)^*

        + ##### The hat lemma

        + ##### Truth lemma

          + For all $\phi \in \mathcal{L}_\square$ and $T \in X^c$, we have: 
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$T \in ||\phi||_{\mathcal{X}^c} \iff T \in (\phi)^*$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

        + {{< logseq/orgIMPORTANT >}}**Proposition**:Every normal extension of S4 that is complete with respect to the standard relational semantics is also complete with respect to the interior semantics. 
{{< / logseq/orgIMPORTANT >}}

          + ##### Examples:

          + We give some examples where this general result is used to prove properties.

            + S4.2 is sound and complete with respect to the class of extremally disconnected topological spaces under the interior semantics. S4.2 is obtained by adding to S4 the axiom 
logseq.order-list-type:: number
{{< logseq/orgCENTER >}}$\lozenge \square p \rightarrow \square \lozenge$
{{< / logseq/orgCENTER >}}

      + 

        + 

        + 

  + #### Generic Spaces

    + Given a language $\mathcal{L}$, a space **X** = $(X, \tau)$ is generic if its sound and complete $\mathcal{L}$-logic is exactly the sound and complete $\mathcal{L}$-logic of *all* topological spaces.

    + > If *X* is generic, then every formula satisfiable in any topo model is satisfiable in a topo-model $(X, \tau, ||\bullet||)$ based on *X*

    + ##### Examples of generic spaces:

      + Note: everu space that is dense in itself is generic. Some examples:

        + The Baire space 
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + The Cantor space
logseq.order-list-type:: number

        + The Real numbers, rational numbers, the irrational numbers etc.
logseq.order-list-type:: number
